        <h2>What is it about</h2>
        <p>
          Do you want to work as a software developer? Are you already learning
          to code and have loads of questions but no one to answer them? Are you
          confident in writing code but struggling to find a job? Or are you
          completely new but you are interested in becoming a dev and not sure
          how to get started? This program is for you! It’s all about starting
          your career in tech!
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Who are we</h2>
        <p>
          We are a group of people with various experience working in tech that
          would like to help you get your way in tech as a software developer.
          We have from junior devs, senior devs to dev leads, so we understand
          the problems you might encounter at every step.
        </p>

        <h2>Why we do this</h2>
        <p>
          We know working in tech can be a good career, but we also know how
          hard it is to get through the door. It’s a lot of competitions, there
          are a lot of young guns fresh out of uni with computer science
          degrees. They are corporate-smart because they have the resources to
          train themselves up from when they were children. They are quick to
          learn because they are free of other stresses in life so they can
          invest their time and effort in building a career instead of
          surviving. Of course they get the jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we don’t want tech to be something only privileged people get
          into. It gets boring when there is no diversity in life experiences.
          We want to equalise tech, one person at a time. We want to give back
          to the community. And we simply enjoy writing code so much that we see
          it as a leisure way of spending time with like-minded friends.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Who is it for</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You are from refugee/asylum seeker background</li>
          <li>You are one of the following:</li>
          <li>
            Either you are totally beginner, keen to learn but not sure how to
            get started
          </li>
          <li>
            or you are currently learning to code in the hope of becoming a
            developer
          </li>
          <li>or you have fair amount of experience and looking for a job</li>
          <li>Highly self-motivated</li>
          <li>
            Committed to spend at least 4 - 6 hr per week on self-guided
            learning
          </li>
          <li>Available for Saturday meetings</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Note:</strong>
        <p>
          Coding is hard but not hard. It’s never about easy or hard, it’s about
          if you want to do it or not. If you are determined, it’s not hard. You
          put the work in and you will get the result. It’s that simple. But it
          is hard in the process because it’s quite different from the things
          you know. When you speak a language, if you make a grammar mistake or
          pronounce something wrong, you are probably still making sense to
          others. But coding is a lot less tolerant, a typo is going to break
          your code and you might spend hours looking somewhere else then find
          out it was just a typo! But once you get used to it, it’s predictable
          and reliable, debugging becomes like solving puzzles, you get a great
          sense of satisfaction when you finally get it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will try our hardest to assist you, but we can only work as hard as
          you do. It is your journey and you do have to invest your time and
          effort into it, there is no magic but hard work. There are going to be
          challenges, you are going to get stuck at one piece of code that just
          won’t work as you expect, it is going to be frustrating when you send
          hundreds of CVs out and don’t hear anything back. But with hard work
          and consistency, and a little bit of help from others, you will get
          there!
        </p>

        <h2>About the Program</h2>
        <p>
          It’s not a quick program that will make you a dev in 30 days. It’s a
          long process. Think about a uni degree, it’s three years full time and
          plus you will have to take into account some learning done in high
          school too. There are companies offering more career-focused bootcamps
          and it’s usually half to one year full time and they expect you to
          join the class 8 hours a day and do homework outside classes so they
          can squeeze all you need to know in that short period of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          So realistically, expect 1 - 2 years if you are serious about becoming
          a software developer, or longer depending on how much time and effort
          you invest in. It's a long process but we are committed to be there
          supporting you through the journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for our program, we are here for the long run but we break things
          up into three-month terms. So we run three terms in a year, each for
          three months. At the start, we set the goals and decide the ways we
          are going to achieve the goal. Then we spend the three months working
          hard on it. At the end, we re-evaluate the goals we set, if we have
          made progress, and tweak our approach knowing more about ourselves
          now. Then we take a break and start again.
        </p>
        <p>It is going to be focusing on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Personalised learning.</strong> We understand everyone is
            different. We all learn at our own speed and ways, we have different
            goals in life. So we will sit with you to help you set realistic
            goals based on your needs and circumstances. We will help you find
            learning materials that suit your style of learning. You will be in
            charge of what you want to learn and how you learn, and you are
            responsible for your progress.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Collaborative environment.</strong> As much as it’s about
            coding, it’s also about collaboration. Soft skills are just as
            important at work. How you communicate with others in the team, how
            you help and how you ask for help, together with the hard skills
            contribute to if you get a job, if your colleagues enjoy working
            with you and if you can resolve conflicts at work. So from day one,
            we want to foster an environment where you can build your soft
            skills. You will be asked to demonstrate your work, to ask for help
            and to help others!
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Real world experience.</strong> We are aiming to organise
            things as close to the real world working environment as possible,
            so you have a good understanding of how things work at work and it
            won’t be like jumping off a cliff when you eventually go into the
            real world. There are opportunities to work on meaningful projects
            that work and fail in the real world.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Is it free?</h2>
        <p>
          To join this program is free at cost, but we expect you to pay back by
          helping other fellow participants when you can, just like how we help
          you. We are all team players here, we want the best for everybody so
          we lend a hand whenever we can. And we believe everybody is good at
          different things, either you get a coding function quicker than
          others, or you are a CV wizard, or you cook amazing food, we all
          appreciate it!
        </p>
        <p>
          But it’s not free in the sense of time and effort, you will be less
          free while you are doing this. The only way you can achieve something
          is to spend the time and work hard on it. You need to set the time for
          yourself and for your team, put the effort in. There will be days you
          wish you are free to do something else, but if you decide it is worth
          the effort doing this and you put the work in, you will see the
          result.

          the time and effort into your goals) while you can also reassess if
          this is still the way you like to go with your career. If the answers
          are both yes, you will be invited to join the next term!
